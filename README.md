Daily Desciption

This repository is for daily consistency and all the updates on how i improve.

## Day1
Created this Repository

## Day2
11🕥
Understand the Concept of Physics for the project Spacetime-Habitat and created the readme for that project.

20:23 
Generated the dataset for physics inspired spacetime distortion.
Commited in git.

## Day3
23:31
Train the model in the generated dataset.

Compare the predicition of model with simplified physics formulation.

Created habitability xones in spacetime (Conceptual).

Project done only Polishing left.
## Day4
00:23 Some issue with calender and commits in github for physics project.
checked the new commit will not have any issue by commiting the calender test.

## Day5
16:44 Lets start new project the project will be hand gesture capture.

## Day6
Not much today only understand the hand gesture again from tutorial.
I might get the Idea more clearly.
I have 3 projects afters this related to hand gesture in my mind -
Dance remember, Model and sound and light - model maybe from d5 and finally well not accurate Idea of 3td but visual from hand like Naruto jutsu or doctor strange magic circle type of things.


## Day7
I wasn't able to code much today in the hand detection project as my Solutions is not showing in mp module.
I need to use older version of python.
If it is like this then i need to start another project of Web3.
The 3rd Idea was of dance steps recognition.

## Day8
well few days and i am struggling to create the project with the hand detection one.
so i shifted my focus towards another project of Bitcoin block.
i run with some issues in the project but i think till tomorrow i will be able to finish it.

## Day9
Created Lightning Network Phase1.

## Day10
Created Phase 2 of Lightning Network Routing.
